Download the Windows installer from https://documentation.wazuh.com/2.0/installation-guide/packages-list/index.html 

You can install it via:

Using the command line (the /S argument is used for unattended installations):

wazuh-agent-2.0.exe /S

Using the GUI:

Double click on the downloaded file and follow the wizard. If unsure, leave default answers.

Once installed, the agent includes a graphical user interface that can be used to configure it, opening the log file or to start/stop the service.


By default all agent files can be found at the following location: C:\Program Files(x86)\ossec-agent.


At this point, your agent is installed and you just need to register and configure it to talk to your manager. 


These steps have to be done by hand, it is not possible to automate it using a script.
For tis reason believe that the .ISO aproach could simplify the instalation process and speed the process to delivery to the end user.

$ /var/ossec/bin/manage_agents
